cleanup RSolr::Ext::Findable
tests/specs -- come on dude

Connection #find method needs serious love
	remove :include_response option -- doing response.docs is easier anyway?!

default_params for Model?

How about:
	select({
		:phrase_filters=>[
			{:title=>['something', :or, 'something else']},
			['blah', :or, 'blah blah']
		],
		:filters => {:something=>['this', :or, 'that'}
	})
